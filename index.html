        <h2 id="why">External, lightweight and non invasive</h2>
        <p>The deterministic timing layer sits outside your existing stack and wraps around processes. It observes and stabilises how events move through the system without modifying payloads, business logic or timestamps.</p>
        <p>DTL is delivered as a lightweight API or sidecar service. No changes to core infrastructure are required; integration is designed to be reversible and straightforward to trial.</p>

        <h2>Drift, jitter and tail behaviour</h2>
        <p>DTL focuses on timing behaviour between events. It targets drift, jitter and long tail latency, aiming to keep flows inside a tighter and more predictable window under bursty load.</p>
        <p>Evaluation packs cover variance and tail behaviour in representative workloads. Details are shared under NDA where needed.</p>
